# Software Asset Policy
## Inventory (CIS 2.1)
The software on all devices is maintained and udpated via the endpoint security software.

## Supported Software (CIS 2.2)
Software patching information is received from MS-ISAC on a monthly basis.  Tickets are created with IT to confirm patching of any received critical patches.

Annually all software is reviewed to determine if it is currently supported.  Tickets are created with IT to upgrade any versions to a supported configuration is available. For those software items not upgradable, the software inventory is updated to note the exception and mitigation controls in place.
