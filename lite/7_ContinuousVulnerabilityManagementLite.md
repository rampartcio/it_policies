# Continuous Vulnerability Management
(Lite)
## Scope
This Policy applies to all Organization owned devices, data and systems, as well as all employees and contractors.
## Vulnerability Management Process (CIS 7.1)
The organization should implement regular external and internal vulnerability scanning as well as referencing vendor sites (Microsoft, Cisco, VMWare, Adobe, etc)  and ISAC advisories to identify vulnerabilities.

## Remediation Process (CIS 7.2)
Once a vulnerability is identified, a ticket should be created for the issue to be resolved. The ticket should remain open until the mitigation has been completed and the vulnerability has been verified to be resolved. If the vulnerability was detected during a scan, the scan should be rerun to verify the vulnerability is not detected.

## Automated Operating System Patch Management (CIS 7.3)
The organization should utilize automated patching to ensure security updates are applied to workstations and servers on a regular (monthly or more frequently) schedule.

## Automated Application Patch Management (CIS 7.4)
When available, automated patching should be configured for enterprise applications.
