# Asset Management Policy
(Lite)
## Inventory (CIS 1.1)
The Organization will maintain an inventory of IT assets including workstations, laptops, physical and virtual servers, networking equipment, printers, tablets and smartphones. These assets will be maintained in the inventory until decommissioned. The inventory should record at least the following fields:

    Type of Asset
    Make/Model
    Serial Number
    Hostname
    MAC Address (if available)
    IP Address (if static)
    Location
    Owner
    Department
    Date of Purchase
    Date of Decommission

### New Assets
New assets will be received, configured, added to inventory and deployed by the IT department. When the asset reaches the end of its service, IT will decommission the asset.

## Unauthorized Devices (CIS 1.2)
The Organization's endpoint protection tool automatically scans the environment weekly to maintain a device inventory and identify new devices.  When a new device is discovered, it creates a ticket with IT for assessment.  The assessed device is either added to the inventory or removed from the network.
