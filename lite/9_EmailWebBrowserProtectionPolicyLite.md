# Email and Web Browser Protections
(Lite)
## Scope
This Policy applies to all Organization owned devices, data and systems, as well as all employees and contractors.
## Use of Only Fully Supported Browsers and Email Clients (CIS 9.1)
Organization email should only be checked using fully supported browsers and email clients. These clients should be kept up-to-date with security patches regularly applied. Users should refrain from checking email on personal devices unless IT has approved the device and the client. Adding organization email to your personal device may result in organization IT gaining the ability to locate, lock or wipe your device without your consent.

## DNS Filtering Services (CIS 9.2)
The organization should use a DNS filtering service for external DNS requests that blocks name resolution for known or suspected malware distribution sites. Several no cost options are listed below.
