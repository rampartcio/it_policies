# Access Control Policy
(Lite)
## Granting Access (CIS 6.1)
The application owner listed in the software inventory for each application is the primary contact for granting of access.  Upon approval, they put in a ticket with IT.  Access requests not coming from the application owner are reviewed with the application owner prior to approval, unless the request has come directly from the HR Designate or the Organization Administrator with direction to skip review.

## Revoking Access (CIS 6.2)
The application owner listed in the software inventory for each application is the primary contact for revocation of access.  Upon approval, they put in a ticket with IT.  Access requests not coming from the application owner are reviewed with the application owner prior to approval, unless the request has come directly from the HR Designate or the Organization Administrator with direction to skip review.

## Multifactor Authentication

### Applications (CIS 6.3)
For each software package that is externally accessible, the software inventory should note whether multifactor authentication is available and, if so, whether it is implemented and, if not, why.  A ticket is created annually with IT to review.

### Remote Access - VPN (CIS 6.4)
If VPN or other remote access is available, document whether MFA is enabled and, if not, why.  A ticket is created annually with IT to review.

### Administrative Access (CIS 6.5)
* Where possible, accounts with administrative access privileges for individuals are created and managed separately from the user's primary account.  A ticket is created annually with IT to review.
* Where available, multifactor authentication is turned on for all enabled administrative access.  A ticket is created annually with IT to review.
